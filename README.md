# Background

The original **Daddy Pika’s Cheat Menu**, a legendary mod for *Crusader Kings III*, was built for earlier game versions but became unstable on 1.13 and above.  I started developing the Daddy Pika fork during the **Roads to Power** era.  

This fork continues **Zhuge’s** work from the Chinese CK3 community for **English and Russian players**. Zhuge has mastered Daddy Pika’s base code, and my goal is to maintain a **stable, bilingual English/Russian fork** for long-term use.

Some players simply need a reliable, functional cheat menu that stays compatible through updates — that’s why this project exists, and why it’s open for others to build on.
