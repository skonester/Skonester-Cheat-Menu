Background
The original Daddy Pika's Cheat Menu, a legendary mod for Crusader Kings III, was designed for earlier versions of the game. Users experienced crashes with version 1.13 and above. Roads to Power is when I got into the game. There are better cheats mods out there but this is just a project I keep going since I love the game so much.
I don't need donation points. Just send them to the bigger CK3 projects that make this game truly great.
Consider this now a fork of Zhuge's work from the Chinese CK3 community but for English players. He has mastered Daddy Pika's codebase and the goal is to keep a steady long-term cheat menu fork even if Zhuge decides to move on. I have rewritten code after each update and is now a English/Russian fork. Some players don't care and just need a functional cheat menu long-term. Which is why its on here
in case people want to make future changes.
