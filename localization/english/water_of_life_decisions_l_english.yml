 start_searching_for_water_of_life_decision_desc:0 "#F 'I have seen two things which cannot reconcile: A man dead without question, and that same man alive again.'#!\n\nWhen Tribune Clavius Aquila fled the madness of Rome, he followed the one the others rejected. As the *Gospel of Mary* records, Peter challenged her: 'Did He really speak with a woman without our knowledge?' But Levi answered: 'If the Savior made her worthy, who are you indeed to reject her?'\n\nClavius became the sword of that worthiness. To protect Mary—disguised by hair dyed red as Roman clay—and their secret children, he drank from the Cup. He became the anchor against the dissolution of matter, guarding the truth she taught: #'The Son of Man is within you. Follow after Him!'#!\n\n#P The Tribune never died. He walks the earth still, the eternal sentinel of the Gnosis.#!\n\n#X #bold ~ TRIBUNE OF THE TENTH, KEEPER OF THE SILENCE ~ \n   ~ 'HE LOVED HER MORE THAN US' ~ \n~ BARBARA, THE REBORN, SHALL RISE ~ #! #!"
