Background
The original Daddy Pika's Cheat Menu, a legendary mod for Crusader Kings III, was designed for earlier versions of the game. Users experienced crashes with version 1.13 and above. Roads to Power is when I got into the game. There are better cheats mods out there but this is just a project I keep going since I love the game so much.
I don't need donation points. Just send them to the bigger CK3 projects that make this game truly great.
Consider this now a fork of Zhuge's work from the Chinese CK3 community but for English players. He has mastered Daddy Pika's codebase and the goal is to keep a steady long-term cheat menu fork even if Zhuge decides to move on. I have rewritten code after each update but best to leave this as a English fork for the time being. Some players don't care and just need a functional cheat menu long-term.

Note to Users
-Some features require a new game start. This is the case with many mods. More than 90 percent of features work with existing save game so you don't have to start a new game.
-Some mods that change the user interface can make this mod not show up or even work. In that case its best to disable all your mods, then use just this one. Finally, then make the changs to your character then disable again. Sorry some users mod lists are large and I don't have the time to test out hundreds of scenarios. This is just a passion project I do for free. Its for newer players who can use this mod to figure out how to be better players without having to eventually use cheats. Its also for vet players who don't care and just want to fix certain issue they come across when playing tall.
-There are some bugs that I am aware of that need fixing. I could spend hours fixing it just for it to break again in an Paradox update. Core features is the overall goal so I apologize for lack of polish in certain areas. Thanks!




if you can't figure out how to install since the game is implemented with Steam Workshop better, this application will set up the right parameters for the mod to install in Paradox so you can just drop and drop it into your Documents\Paradox Interactive\Crusader Kings III\mod folder. Then relaunch the Paradox Launcher.
